The S3 bucket for this project had been created via the management console on a personal account due to the issue that was faced when trying to utilize the "sandbox environment"
or other AWS labs for the S3.  Therefore, unfortunately a S3.tf file wasn't made or attached to this project, but the S3 had been created, and the program still ran properly
and our WordPress website was able to be downloaded and stored in the personal S3 account.
